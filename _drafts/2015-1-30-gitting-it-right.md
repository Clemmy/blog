For a while now, I have known Git, but I haven't been _using_ Git. Sure, I have been using the common git pull, git push, git merge, git branch, but using it so broadly was very different to the things that I can do with it today. (there were a lot of gotchas?/catches i didn't know about) For example, did you know that your master should only contain stable releases that are production ready? Did you know that you can keep your working tree very clean by using a rebase approach rather than the merge work flow? If not, you were in the same boat as I was a few weeks ago, but in this post, I will link to some useful tutorials that got me up to speed with Git (atlassian and the interactive thing)

For starters, reading up Atlassians' basic tutorial will help you understand the basics of the Git commands. It is short, yet concise, and goes 95% of all the commands that you will be using on a daily basis. In my experience, it will take two to three hours maximum to read through, assuming you have some sort of understanding of Git. However, it was very descriptive and helpful, using a ton of diagrams and examples to reinforce my understanding of the different concepts.

Next, you can go through an interactive Git tutorial n on branching/basing? (maybe skip) idk

next, in the workplace, blah blah , link git flow pic, discuss some common commands for their use cases
