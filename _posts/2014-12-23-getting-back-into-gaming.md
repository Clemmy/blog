Hello fellow blog readers, and happy holidays! In my last blog post, I said I would try to post more frequently, but this post ended up having a longer period of delay than the rest, unfortunately. I actually began writing this post a few weeks ago, but I never really got around to completing it because of exams (I actually ended up editing this first paragraph around three times). Just a few days ago, I completed a pretty tough 2A term, consisting of six courses: Chemistry, Microeconomics, Statistics, Compilers, Digital Computers, and Computational Logic. With the term now over, it is only weeks before I begin my four-month co-op term as a web developer at [Ten Thousand Coffees](https://www.tenthousandcoffees.com/), _Hurrah!_

Anyway, the main purpose of this post is to talk a bit about gaming. From the several weeks leading up to exams until now, when I am recovering from exams, I have picked up a couple of games. One being [Fire Emblem - Heroes of Light and Shadow](http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_Shin_Monsh%C5%8D_no_Nazo_~Hikari_to_Kage_no_Eiy%C5%AB~), an addition to one of my favourite video game series, and the other being [Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/en/int?r=hearthstone), the new free-to-play Collectible Card Game by Blizzard.

#Fire Emblem
The Fire Emblem series is a collection of turn-based tactical RPG video games (Imagine chess on steroids!). Each game generally features a lord character and a beautiful storyline that revolves around that character. The player is the strategist who commands all their characters, and will try to maneuver all the friendly units in a way to successfully achieve the mission goals. There is an experience system involved, so as your units can level up and get stronger. In summary, Fire Emblem contains much of what I look for in a video game: good graphics, good plot, and tactics. More information about this series is available on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem).

#Hearthstone

Onto the more well-known game, Hearthstone! As I said earlier, Hearthstone is a collectible card game made by Blizzard. Coming from a Yugioh background (Yes, I used to be pretty serious in Yugioh; my username is __Killic__ on [DuelingNetwork](http://www.duelingnetwork.com/)), there are several differences in these two card games.

- CCG vs. TCG: Hearthstone is a collectible card game, where cards have to be gathered from card packs or earned through achievements in-game, whereas Yugioh is a trading card game, where cards can be attained from card packs and traded from player to player.
- Simple vs. complicated game mechanics: Hearthstone is a very simple to pick up game; it has very few rules and personally, it only took me a few hours to get accustomed to, whereas in Yugioh, there are many nit-picky rules and even after years of playing, I still find rulings slightly tricky
- Card Pool Difference: In Hearthstone, there are class-specific cards and nine heroes that the player can choose from. Players build decks tailored to their particular hero, and the amount of cards in Hearthstone is quite limited (I am able to recognize around 80% of the current card pool after a few weeks of playing). On the other hand, Yugioh has a much vaster card pool with no class-specific cards. It took me months of playing before becoming familiar with most of the meta, and I still had to keep up to date with it every few weeks.
- Digital vs. Physical: Hearthstone is a digital card game, so most actions are automated by software and rulings are absolute, as decided by the software. However, in Yugioh, there are often ruling debates between players. Additionally, since Yugioh is a physical game, there is an extra layer of the game which involves reading the other player's subtle eye movements, gestures, and card sleeves. Cheating is also more prominent in a physical card game since things like shuffling is not truly randomized.

However, despite these differences, they also both possess similar elements that make them fun to play: they involve elements of strategy, predicting your opponent's possible moves, and countering them. From playing Yugioh, I was able to transfer a lot of my understanding over: tempo, card advantage, early aggression, lethal, card value, and card synergy. Both involve strategy, poker-facing, and a hint of luck!

Playing Hearthstone for a few week, it seems like a game I would be playing for a while, and I am trying to get better in it. I have been playing with pretty budget decks so far, but I am continuing to look for ways to improve my win ratio. Unsurprisingly, there are many resources that Hearthstone players can use to improve their game. It ranges from open-source analytical statistics software such as [Track-o-bot](https://trackobot.com/) and [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker) to streaming pro players such as [StrifeCro](http://www.twitch.tv/strifecro) on Twitch, and even using the deck builder tool on [HearthPwn](http://www.hearthpwn.com/). Actually, with so many products out there already, I am finding it hard to come up with something to make for myself. I really want to contribute to the Hearthstone community, but I'm not sure how. If you guys have any suggestions, do comment below!

#Conclusion

Both of these games are very fun and I would encourage everyone who is into strategy games to try them out! If anyone wants to add me as a friend on Hearthstone, that would be great. My BattleTag is ```Clemmy#1610```. Happy holidays and happy gaming!
